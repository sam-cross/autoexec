# Counter-Strike Configs

This repo contains my configs (autoexec) for CS:GO and CS:S.

These are built based upon configs by other players, with some customisations that make the games easier for me to play.

## Using These Configs

Simply copy the respective `autoexec.cfg` file from the `csgo` or `css` directory to: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\<GAME>\XXXX\cfg\` (replace `<GAME>` with the game title and `XXXX` with `csgo` or `css` depending on the game).

Customise as needed. I'd highly recommend changing resolution and mouse sensitivity - I play on a stupidly high DPI setting.

## Resources

Here are a few resources to help you configure your game.
